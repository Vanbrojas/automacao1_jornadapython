# Automation Project with Python - Product Registration

In this project, developed during the **Python Power UP** course, we automated the process of registering products on a website.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Imagine having 500 products, prices, or any kind of information that needs to be registered in a system. Manually entering all this data would be time-consuming and tedious, possibly taking several days of work.

With this project, we learned how to automate such a process using **Python**. The program controls the mouse and keyboard to execute tasks as if it were a human user — logging into a website and automatically registering multiple products.

## 🛠️ What you'll learn

- Automate mouse and keyboard actions using Python.
- Work with structured data (spreadsheets) for automation.
- Use libraries like **pyautogui** and **pandas** for data handling and GUI automation.
- Understand basic concepts of automation applied to repetitive tasks.

## 💻 How it works

1. Access a specific website designed for this lesson.
2. Log into the system.
3. Automatically read product data from a dataset.
4. Register all products on the website without manual intervention.

## 📂 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- pyautogui
- time

## ▶️ How to run

- Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Vanbrojas/automacao1_jornadapython.git

- Navigate to the project directory:
  
cd automacao1_jornadapython

- Run the script:
  
python automacao_1.py

Important: Make sure the simulated website is open and ready for automation, and avoid moving the mouse or typing while the script is running.

## ✅ Features

- Reads product data from a dataset.
- Automatically logs into a website.
- Fills in product information using mouse and keyboard automation.
- Speeds up repetitive tasks, reducing human error.
